# Student Management System

There are two roles in my project: Teacher and Student.

When a student is logged in, they can view the courses they have enrolled in. On this screen, the student can add new courses or delete existing ones.

Students can view the list of homework assignments for each course.

Students can view the list of announcements for each course.
